# ML Autoencoder MNIST Digits
## Description 
This project features an autoencoder model trained to encode, compress, and decode hand-written digits.
There are two files, model_functions.py which contains the functions and structure of the model. Secondly, there is
interactive.py which provides a small GUI screen to draw a digit 0-9. The user's drawing can be inputted into the 
trained model by pressing a key in which the neural network outputs its guess.

## Installation
* Pip install h5py (built with 3.1.0)
* Pip install tensorflow (built with 2.5.0)
* Pip install numpy (built with 1.19.5)
* Pip install pygame (built with 2.0.1 - for interactive.py)

## Usage
Before running any python files please make sure you have completed ALL above installation steps.

Read model_functions.py function build_model, to see the structure of the autoencoder.  
If you run model_functions.py, it will build and train a new model which will overwrite the existing saved model
and weights.
The newly trained model will be evaluated, and it's accuracy outputted.

Upon running interactive.py, a window will pop up. FINISH WRITING THIS...

## Note
This is my first autoencoder machine learning project, inspired by the book,
Generative Deep Learning by David Foster. As well as tutorial by sentdex on YouTube.
